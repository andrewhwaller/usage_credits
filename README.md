# ðŸ’³ `usage_credits` - Add a usage-based credits system to your Rails app

[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/usage_credits.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/usage_credits)

Allow your users to have in-app credits they can use to perform operations.

Perfect for SaaS, AI apps, and API products that want to implement usage-based pricing.

`usage_credits` integrates with the `pay` gem both to refill credits through subscriptions, and so you can easily sell credit packs through Stripe, Lemon Squeezy, PayPal or any `pay`-supported processor.

With `usage_credits`, you can:
- Keep track of each user's credits
- Define how many credits any operation in your app costs
- Create and sell credit packs
- Refill credits through subscriptions (monthly, yearly, etc.)
- Track every credit transaction with detailed history and audit trail

All with a simple DSL that reads just like English.

## Example

Say you have a `User` model. You add `has_credits` to it and you're ready to go:

```ruby
@user.give_credits(100, reason: "signup")
```

Now you can check the balance:
```ruby
@user.credits
=> 100
```

And perform operations:
```ruby
@user.has_enough_credits_to?(:send_email)
=> true

# Spend credits after actually performing the operation
@user.spend_credits_on(:send_email)

# Then check the remaining balance
@user.credits
=> 99
```

This gem keeps track of every transaction and its cost + origin, so you can keep a clean audit trail for clear invoicing and reference / auditing purposes:
```ruby
@user.credit_history.pluck(:category, :amount)
=> [["signup_bonus", 100], ["operation_charge", -1]]
```

Each transaction stores comprehensive metadata about the action that was performed:
```ruby
@user.credit_history.last.metadata
=> {"operation"=>"send_email", "cost"=>1, "params"=>{}, "metadata"=>{}, "executed_at"=>"2025-01-12T01:12:12.123Z"}
```

The `usage_credits` gem also allows you to expire credits, fulfill credits based on monthly / yearly subscriptions, sell credit packs, rollover unused credits to the next billing period, and more! Keep reading to get a clear picture of what you can do.


## Quick start

Add the gem to your Gemfile:
```ruby
gem 'usage_credits'
```

Then run:
```bash
bundle install
rails generate usage_credits:install
rails db:migrate
```

Add `has_credits` your user model (or any model that needs to have credits):
```ruby
class User < ApplicationRecord
  has_credits
end
```

That's it! Your app now has a usage credits system. Let's see how to use it:

## How it works

`usage_credits` makes it dead simple to add a usage-based credits system to your Rails app:

1. Users can get credits by:
  - Purchasing credit packs (e.g., "1000 credits for $49")
  - Having a subscription (e.g., "Pro plan includes 10,000 credits/month")
  - Getting bonuses (e.g., "100 free credits for referring a user")

2. Users spend credits on operations you define:
  - "Sending an email costs 1 credit"
  - "Processing an image costs 10 credits + 0.5 credits per MB"

Forst, let's see how to define these credit-consuming operations.

## Define credit-consuming operations and set credit costs

Define all your operations and their cost in your `config/initializers/usage_credits.rb`.

For example, create a simple operation named `send_email` that costs 1 credit to perform:

```ruby
# Simple fixed cost
operation :send_email do
  cost 1.credit
end
```

You can get quite sophisticated in pricing, and define the cost of your operations based on parameters:
```ruby
# Cost based on size
operation :process_image do
  cost 10.credits + 0.5.credits_per(:mb)
  validate ->(params) { params[:size] <= 100.megabytes }, "File too large"
end
```

It's also possible to add validations and metadata to your operations:

```ruby
# With custom validation
operation :generate_ai_response do
  cost 5.credits
  validate ->(params) { params[:prompt].length <= 1000 }, "Prompt too long"
end

# With metadata for better tracking
operation :analyze_data do
  cost 20.credits
  meta category: :analytics, description: "Deep data analysis"
end
```

## Spend credits

There's a handy `has_enough_credits_to?` method to nicely check the user has enough credits to perform a certain operation. After that, you can spend withÂ `spend_credits_on`:

```ruby
# Check if user has enough credits
if user.has_enough_credits_to?(:process_image, size: 5.megabytes)
  # Spend credits and perform the actual operation
  user.spend_credits_on(:process_image, size: 5.megabytes) if process_image(params)
else
  redirect_to credits_path, alert: "Not enough credits!"
end
```

> [!TIP]
> Make the credit spend conditional to the actual operation, so users are not charged credits if the operation fails to perform.

## Sell credit packs

> [!TIP]
> For all payment-related operations (sell credit packs, handle subscription-based fulfillment, etc. this gem relies on the [`pay`](https://github.com/pay-rails/pay) gem â€“ make sure you have it installed and correctly configured before continuing)

In the `config/initializers/usage_credits.rb` file, define packs of credits users can buy:

```ruby
credit_pack :starter do
  includes 1000.credits
  costs 49.dollars
end
```

Then, you can prompt then to purchase it with our `pay`-based helpers:
```ruby
# Create a Stripe Checkout session for purchase
pack = UsageCredits.packs[:starter]
session = pack.create_checkout_session(current_user)
redirect_to session.url
```

The gem automatically handles Stripe webhooks to credit the user's wallet after purchase.

## Subscription plans with credits

Give credits with subscriptions:

```ruby
subscription_plan :pro do
  gives 10_000.credits.per_month
  signup_bonus 1_000.credits
  trial_includes 500.credits
  unused_credits :rollover  # Credits roll over to next month
end
```

When a user subscribes to a plan (via the `pay` gem), they'll automatically have their credits refilled.

## Transaction history & audit trail

Every credit transaction is automatically tracked with detailed metadata:

```ruby
# Get recent activity
user.credit_history.recent

# Filter by type
user.credit_history.by_category(:operation_charge)
user.credit_history.by_category(:subscription_monthly)

# Audit operation usage
wallet.transactions
  .where(category: :operation_charge)
  .where("metadata->>'name' = ?", 'process_image')
  .where(created_at: 1.month.ago..)
```

Each operation charge includes detailed audit metadata:
```ruby
{
  name: "process_image",                   # Operation name
  cost: 15,                                # Actual cost charged
  metadata: { category: "image" },         # Custom metadata
  executed_at: "2024-01-19T16:57:16Z",     # When executed
  params: { size: 1024 },                  # Parameters used
  version: "1.0.0"                         # Gem version
}
```

This makes it easy to:
- Track historical costs
- Audit operation usage
- Generate detailed invoices
- Monitor usage patterns

## Low balance alerts

Notify users when they are running low on credits (useful to upsell them a credit pack):

```ruby
UsageCredits.configure do |config|
  # Alert when balance drops below 100 credits
  config.low_balance_threshold = 100.credits
  
  # Handle low credit balance alerts
  config.on_low_balance do |user|
    UserMailer.low_credits_alert(user).deliver_later
  end
end
```

## Advanced usage

### Numeric extensions

The gem adds several convenient methods to Ruby's `Numeric` class to make the DSL read naturally:

```ruby
# Credit amounts
1.credit      # => 1 credit
10.credits    # => 10 credits

# Pricing
49.dollars    # => 4900 cents (for Stripe)

# Sizes and rates
0.5.credits_per(:mb)  # => 0.5 credits per megabyte
100.megabytes        # => 100 MB (uses Rails' numeric extensions)
```

### Custom credit formatting

```ruby
UsageCredits.configure do |config|
  # Format as "1,000 credits remaining"
  config.format_credits do |amount|
    "#{number_with_delimiter(amount)} credits remaining"
  end
end
```

### Credit expiration

```ruby
# Credits expire after inactivity
UsageCredits.configure do |config|
  config.expire_credits_after 1.year
end

# Or per subscription
subscription_plan :basic do
  gives 1000.credits.per_month
  expire_after 30.days.of_cancellation
end
```

### Rounding strategy

Configure how credit costs are rounded:

```ruby
UsageCredits.configure do |config|
  config.rounding_strategy = :floor  # Options: :round, :floor, :ceil
end
```

## Testing

Testing is a breeze with our test helpers:

```ruby
# spec/rails_helper.rb
RSpec.configure do |config|
  config.include UsageCredits::TestHelpers
end

# In your tests
RSpec.describe "Image Processing" do
  it "charges correct credits" do
    user = create(:user)
    give_test_credits(user, 1000)
    
    expect {
      user.spend_credits_on(:process_image, size: 5.megabytes)
    }.to change { user.credits }.by(-35)
  end
end
```

## Development
