module UsageCredits
  # An Allocation links a *negative* (spend) transaction
  # to a *positive* (credit) transaction, indicating how many
  # credits were taken from that specific credit source.
  #
  # Allocations are the basis for the bucket-based, FIFO-with-expiration inventory-like system
  # This is critical for calculating balances when there are mixed expiring and non-expiring credits
  # Otherwise, balance calculations will always be wrong because negative transactions get dragged forever
