`usage_credits` has been installed! ðŸŽ‰

Quick Start:
-----------

1. Run the migrations:
   $ rails db:migrate

2. Check the initializer at config/initializers/usage_credits.rb
   It contains example configurations for operations, credit packs, and subscription rules.

3. Your User model has been configured with has_credits.
   You can now use credit operations like:

   user.credits  # Get current balance
   user.give_credits(100, reason: "signup_bonus")  # Add credits
   user.spend_credits_on(:process_image, size: 5.megabytes)  # Use credits

4. Set up payment integration (optional):
   - Add your payment processor keys (Stripe, Lemon Squeezy, PayPal etc.) via the pay gem
   - Configure webhook endpoints for payment events
   - Define credit packs in the initializer
   - Test credit pack purchases with:
     pack = UsageCredits.packs[:starter]
     session = pack.create_checkout_session(current_user)
