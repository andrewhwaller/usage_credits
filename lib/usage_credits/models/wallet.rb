    # Get current credit balance
    #
    # The first naive approach was to compute this as a sum of all non-expired transactions like:
    #   transactions.not_expired.sum(:amount)
    # but that fails when we mix expiring and non-expiring credits: https://x.com/rameerez/status/1884246492837302759
    #
    # So we needed to introduce the Allocation model
    #
    # Now to calculate current balance, instead of summing:
    # we sum only unexpired positive transactions’ remaining_amount
    def credits
      # Sum the leftover in all *positive* transactions that haven't expired
      transactions
        .where("amount > 0")
